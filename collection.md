Monster Evolution is a collection of 1,000 completely unique animations. Each of these animations is generated by a Deep Learning model that I trained for several weeks. Because of this, each animation is guaranteed to be 100% unique. I was inspired to create this project after seeing all of the randomly generated NFTs that are built from pre-designed attributes. I challenged myself to put together a collection of truly randomly generated art pieces.
